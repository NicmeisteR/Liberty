Liberty
===

Liberty is the first Halo 4, Halo: Reach, Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 3, and Halo 3: ODST campaign editor that is 100% free and doesn't require registration. It also supports more features than all of the current editors around. 100% of it was made from our own research and we had no help at all from anyone who already had information on campaign saves. It is licensed under the version 2 of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
